### Lessons learned
- There are HTML  `<audio>`  tags which are used to embed sound content in a document.
- By adding `data-*` attributes, even ordinary HTML elements can become rather complex and powerful program-objects.
- To store  extra information that doesnâ€™t have any visual representation use `data` attributes.
